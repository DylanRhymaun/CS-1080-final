            <p> Welcome to my site! My name is Dylan Rhymaun and I am an artist and writer based in Burlington, Vermont. This site is just for fun since I work professionally in higher education administration at the University of Vermont, but I like to mess around with 3D art, game design, web design (learning), and photography in my spare time. I also write for various organizations in the area on occasion. <br>Prior to focusing on digital work, I attended film school in Toronto before transferring to UVM in 2017. There, I graduated with my B.A. in English and minors in Film Studies and Economics. I am starting my Master's in Education in June 2024, but plan to continue learning more about computer programming and web design when I have the time to. <br> Apart from the productive hobbies, you can also catch me skateboarding around Burlington or jogging on the bike path on weekends. I'm also an avid video game, movie, and anime fan, so send me recommendations via the contact page if you have any! <br>Once again, thanks for vising my site! </p>
