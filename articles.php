                <h2>A BIPOC perspective of the 2022 CCRPC ECOS Report</h2>
                <p><em>Originally published in the VTPOC Newsletter, Jan 31, 2024</em><br>There’s a high likelihood that the person reading this is a resident of Chittenden county, or more specifically, an urban center such as Burlington, Winooski, South Burlington, and others. I make such a claim because I recently stumbled upon a scorecard from 2021 provided by the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission, which gives insight into where and how BIPOC communities live. The ECOS scorecard, which is released annually, stands for Environment; Community; Opportunity; Sustainability. One statistic that stood out to me was the comparable rates of immigration to Chittenden county amongst white vs nonwhite individuals; a whopping 99.7% of population growth over the last 10 years is that of BIPOC individuals. Meanwhile, in a rural, agriculture-centric county such as Franklin County (which accounts for 24% of Vermont’s agricultural sales per the VT Council of Rural Development), BIPOC populations have seen an even greater shift, with white populations actually leaving the area at a greater percentage than in Chittenden amongst an overall +2,220 population change. This gives rise to the question, who are these BIPOC populations outside of urban areas, why did they choose to live rural, and what can be done to better support them?<br> Franklin County, as already stated, is extremely agriculture-centric. It is the 59th highest milk-producing county in the entire United States, at over $129 Million in exports in 2017 per the USDA. A 2010 report indicates that dairy farms in Vermont are supported by up to 1500 migrant workers, and that number has surely grown significantly over the last decade (VTMFSP.org). Blue collar farm labor attracts migrants for better or for worse, due to relatively low governmental and managerial oversight.<br> The caveat to these employment opportunities is that the working conditions in dairy production are less than ideal. Per the organization Migrant Justice, 40% of dairy workers make less than the state minimum wage forcing 15% of them to live in overcrowded homes with little access to sufficient heat. 40% also report having no days off, and another 20% claim to be victims of wage theft at some point in their employment. Much of this is due to the fact that 96% of dairy farms in Franklin County are family owned and operated. This data indicates a trend of family farms hiring desperate new Vermonters only to exploit their labor for low, under-the-table pay. <br> Thankfully, some large buyers of milk products have agreed to incorporate Migrant Justice’s code of conduct into their supply chain, ensuring that workers are paid fairly and work under decent conditions. However, with Franklin having over $100 million in milk exports alone, there is a lot of work left to be done to ensure all migrant workers in Vermont, including those in other aspects of agriculture apart from dairy, are treated fairly.<br> One other major issue facing the rural BIPOC community in Vermont is housing availability. Between 2016 and 2020, 87% of homes built in Vermont were built in areas “planned for growth” (CCRPC, 2020). This refers mainly to apartment buildings such as those by the old Burlington College campus, or the UVM sponsored development in South Burlington that was announced recently. These lands are proposed by construction companies and approved by local municipalities, often years in advance of any work actually beginning. While new housing opportunities are great for renters who live in these areas (by driving down rents for existing, poorly maintained housing), what this statistic also shows is the lack of rural developments. Workers in the Agriculture sector, particularly, see little change in three important aspects of their lives: housing alternatives, rent competition, and importantly, opportunities for home ownership. As if it was not already hard enough for a new POC Vermonter due to language, credit, discriminatory barriers, et cetera, the absence of new constructions outside of urban settings maintains a status quo of high rents for old units, that often end up being a sunk cost to renters thanks to already poor wages, while barring them from planning for future investments in themselves and their communities.<br> Vermont as a whole, along with local municipal governments, can do more to serve new and existing residents. Better oversight of small businesses and who they employ can help increase essential worker’s quality of lives. Promoting development of shared zoning buildings, as well as units available for purchase instead of just rentals, can help everyone invest in their own future. </p>

                <h2>The Realities of Health Inequity in Vermont</h2>
                <p><em> Originally published in the VTPOC Newsletter, Oct 31, 2023</em><br>Addressing racism in healthcare is often seen  as a complex problem without a simple solution. Health-related scenarios  involve many factors that make each patient unique with countless  variables at play. Therefore, it’s not appropriate to make sweeping  judgments about the healthcare system based solely on individual  experiences unless there is clear evidence of egregious malpractice.  That being said, it remains perplexing that Black Americans have a life  expectancy that is four years shorter than that of white Americans. One  of the most evident explanations for this discrepancy is linked to a  common theme VT PoC advocates against: the presence of systemic racism  within healthcare, which reflects the broader systemic racism prevalent  in society and the undervaluing of BIPOC lives.<br> Let’s  keep it local. As with anything in the United States, it’s crucial to  consider historical context due to the consistent failures in addressing  racist policies and practices. Vermont, in particular, has a very  specific racist relationship with healthcare disparities in the form of  the eugenics movement.<br> Eugenics is a field  of study that aims to weed out less desirable genetic traits through  experimentation and controlled reproduction. It was discredited after  World War II due to its association with Nazism, but had a significant  impact on our state from 1925 to 1936.<br> Guy  W. Bailey, president of UVM from 1919 to 1940, approved the Eugenics  Survey of Vermont, under the recommendation and leadership of Zoology  professor Henry Perkins. The survey subjected Vermonters to harsh  evaluations of their mental well-being by their practitioners. It  recommended resettlement, and prior to a law banning it in 1931,  sterilization of those deemed feebleminded. Even after 1931, surveyors  could reject marriages for those they deemed unfit to reproduce. Where  this ties into our newsletter topic is that it was racist practitioners  who determined who was worthy of reproduction. Native Vermonters,  members of the Abenaki tribe, suffered from this survey. Abenaki  individuals were forcefully sterilized and institutionalized, and many  children were separated from parents who were judged as unfit to care  for them by surveyors.<br> Systematic racism in one of its ugliest forms if I’ve ever read it.<br> Fast  forward to healthcare in Vermont today, the lasting effects of past  atrocities are apparent. Healthcare spending per person is at an all  time high, as are distrust in doctors across political divides due to  misinformation, propaganda, and past failures like the eugenics survey.  Immigrant and refugee populations have risen significantly, and the need  for more medical practitioners has never been greater.<br> Many  solutions to address racial disparities in treatment are only loosely  addressed. A 2022 study by the state found that adult Vermonters of  color are almost twice as likely to delay treatment due to the  associated costs. The same survey found that in Vermont, 69% of white  patients felt their cultural identity was respected, whereas less than  half of Black patients did. Asian patients were even lower at 43%, and  Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders reported an astonishing figure of  only 36% feeling that their cultural identity was respected by medical  professionals. Respect for cultural identity is critical to one’s  treatment because it informs their trust in that treatment, their  comfort and stress (which often aids their physical wellbeing), and  their willingness to continue to receive care.<br> You’d  think that an easy solution would be to simply hire more physicians of  color – but the federal government doesn’t make that so easy. For  starters, the financial barriers to even apply to medical school is  unfair. The Medical School Admission Test (MCAT) is one that applicants  often spend months studying for, and costs hundreds of dollars to take.  That money is barely a drop in the bucket compared to the cost of  actually applying to medical school, which can cost anywhere from  $100-$500 per school. Moreover, only 43% of applicants applying last  year were accepted. This figure could potentially be higher and allow  more doctors to be trained. However, the real problem arises when they  finish their four years of schooling. From there, students must apply to  residency programs. These residency programs are capped by the federal  government based on an arbitrary budget set in the late 90s and  restricts the number of doctors who can be trained at a given time, not  taking into account the number of students graduating from medical  school. For BIPOC applicants, who often face financial disparities  compared to white Americans, the financial burden can outweigh the risk  of not getting into medical school or a residency slot.<br> Despite  lack of action on the national level, there are some strides being made  in the right direction within Vermont. Two that come to mind are  initiatives by UVM and VT PoC ourselves.<br> The  College of Nursing and Health Sciences at UVM have two peer mentoring  programs in which all first year students are automatically enrolled in.  One, called LinkUp, is in its relative infancy, aims to connect BIPOC  students to BIPOC upperclassmen to make them more comfortable, seen,  and  guide them through academia. This is important because it not only  tries to increase retention of BIPOC students as students, but also as  medical practitioners.<br> In response to the  COVID-19 pandemic, VT PoC launched the Vermont Health Equity Initiative,  which set up vaccine clinics focused on BIPOC and immigrant  communities. By creating a space for culturally sensitive care, many  community members of color were vaccinated when they may have otherwise  not been. The fact that Vermont was the fastest state to reach an 80%  vaccination rate is a testament to the importance of cultural  understanding in healthcare.</p>

                <h2>The Job Hunter’s AI</h2>
                <p><em>Originally published in the VTPOC Newsletter, July 31, 2023</em><br>For those who stay up to date with the latest  technologies and trends on the internet, the rise of artificial  intelligence is old news. Almost everyone has seen AI generated images  featuring things ranging from faked social media posts, to more alarming  images of political events that never occurred. This article, though,  will focus on the practical applications of the AI-revolution; how it  will affect the job market, the workforce, and the BIPOC community. The  most surprising part of the AI craze is that it is not the harmless  generated images that will have the largest impact on our lives, it’s  plain text.<br>Before moving on, it is  important to recognize AI’s capabilities, or lack thereof, and its  relationship in representing the BIPOC community. AI applications we’ve  seen spring up over the last year are neural networks: a system  that is modeled off the human brain to help solve complex problems, see  patterns, and make predictions. It does this by using data to train  itself to respond to prompts given by the user. This differs from  machine learning, a strategy that has been around for years, in  that machine learning does not have the capabilities to form bias, it  simply learns what users want. An uncontrolled network can choose to  discriminate and exclude groups in things like sorting algorithms or  surveys. Moreover, under a neural network, biased responses are  generated when biased data is used. This is most prevalent in image  generation, something machine learning was previously unable to do,  where users found that depictions of various scenarios, such as crime,  promote racist stereotypes about certain groups.<br>Most  of the controversy surrounding AI, however, is regarding the potential  replacement of workers, specifically in the arts. Photographers, graphic  designers, 3D artists, and even musicians and filmmakers are all soon  to be at risk. As these neural networks grow and become more consumer  friendly, hiring an artist to create an art piece will be thousands –  potentially millions – of times more expensive than the AI-generated  alternative. <br>That said, it is not only the  arts that are at risk. Many entry level white collar jobs can be easily  replaced by text and code generation. ChatGPT, the world’s most popular  AI text generator, has capabilities that defy many new user’s  expectations. Copywriting, marketing write ups, email correspondence, et  cetera, can be written convincingly, for free, and in a matter of  seconds. Further, ChatGPT has capabilities to create and analyze  spreadsheets, plus complex math is incorporated and explained in a  breeze. Programming jobs, once thought to be in the highest demand, will  soon meet a similar fate. While the current version of ChatGPT still  has trouble writing complex, all in one scripts, it can create entire  websites with HTML and CSS perfectly without the user having ever  written a line of code in their life. As time goes on, accuracy will  expand to successfully produce code in any language, for any  application. <br>This is not all bad news. The  most effective users of these applications do not use them to replace  their jobs, but merely to make them more efficient. Writers can get  ideas, proofread, and generate outlines to streamline the writing  process. Artists can quickly generate inspiration, references or  filler/details for their work in a variety of mediums, allowing for more  time to focus on whatever they deem important. Pertinent to VT PoC, job  seekers may find significant benefit by using AI in the job applicant  process. Drafts of cover letters can be generated quickly and accurately  by simply copying and pasting job descriptions plus information about  the applicant into a prompt. This alone can significantly decrease the  time and effort it takes to submit an application, and can be especially  valuable to those needing to find a job under a time constraint. <br>It  should be noted that applications like these will fill in any gaps with  false or misleading information, so never submit anything without  reviewing, correcting, and making it your own.<br>In  addition to supporting productivity, there’s an argument that what  roles AI can replace are those that should be phased out anyways. Data  entry, and stock photography, two examples that can be eliminated today,  are undesirable and lackluster positions in most cases. Assuming AI has  the power to replace these jobs with accuracy and precision, Is it not  natural that these roles are outsourced in the same way coal mining with  lanterns and pickaxes were? <br>To get an  artist’s perspective on the threat of neural networks, VT PoC reached  out to Onyekachi Ngameze, a Burlington-based artist and designer for  their thoughts.<br>“The rise of AI has made me wonder about the future of art. Recently, we saw that the opening intro to Marvel’s Secret Invasion  was made with AI. We see songs and videos made with AI using the  likeness and voices of real people. On one hand, I believe that AI has  allowed large corporations to further exploit the work of human artists  while also denying artists from marginalized groups entry into the  industry. On the other hand, I see AI simply as code. When Adobe came  out with their programs, it was believed that the role of the fine  artist was rendered obsolete. However, we found that this new technology  was only as powerful as the user. AI could never truly beat out human  artists because we are the source material for this technology.”<br>In  the grand scheme of things, the AI revolution is still in its infancy,  and time will tell whether these ethical concerns are ever addressed.  That being said, it is an unstoppable force with little indication that  it will be regulated any time soon. Are you willing to take advantage of  it? <br>For more information on this topic, see our monthly spotlight article featuring Coumba Win.<br>Check out Onyekachi’s work at bymezzy.com!</p>

                <h2>Morality in 10 Cloverfield Lane</h2>
                <p><em>Originally written for Horror and Psychoanalysis at the University of Vermont</em><br>10 Cloverfield Lane (2016, dir. Dan Trachtenberg) does what few sequels in the science fiction and horror genres attempt: it changes subgenres entirely. It follows 2008’s Cloverfield, a found footage blockbuster about a giant monster attacking New York City, and a man with a camera just trying to survive. Its sequel, which was released a whole eight years later, follows a young woman, Michelle (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who is knocked unconscious in a car accident, and held in an underground bunker by a man who claims to have saved her from a nuclear apocalypse. Not unlike Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs (1994), 10 Cloverfield Lane takes place almost entirely in a single location and with only a handful of actors. The film uses the tight, claustrophobic setting of the underground bunker to provide the audience themselves with a greater sense of anxiety. This is exacerbated by the main antagonist of the film, Howard Stambler (played by John Goodman), who physically towers over his two captives and intimidates them both physically, and subtly with guilt. This essay examines the actions and precautions taken by Howard, and attempts to determine whether Howard is the true villain, or a savior. 10 Cloverfield Lane effectively portrays the dilemma facing the captives by blurring the line between savior and kidnapper in its antagonist. <br>For the purposes of this analysis, the film’s ending, specifically after Michelle leaves the bunker, will be ignored. Howard is killed prior to her escape, hence there is no need to take these events into consideration. However, it is worth noting that Howard was correct in that the apocalypse had occurred in the outside world, but that it was due to an alien invasion opposed to the hypothesized nuclear war Howard had claimed. <br>Perceiving Howard as ill-intentioned is not difficult in the first act of the film. Following the car crash, Michelle wakes up in an empty room, handcuffed, and with a needle attached to a saline drip in her arm. The room is aesthetically similar to that in Saw (2004, Dir. James Wan), with sickly green walls and flickering fluorescent lighting. Following Howard’s explanation of their situation, Michelle is able to settle into her new home. Throughout the second act, Michelle and the third survivor, a carpenter named Emmett (played by John Gallagher Jr.), uncover clues as to who Howard really is, his motives, and whether or not it is safe to leave the bunker. <br>One of the first events to support the hypothesis that Howard is ill-intentioned, is the significant plot point revolving around his daughter. Howard introduces Megan by showing the two a photo of her and explaining that she has since passed. Later, when fixing an air duct that leads to a room above ground, Michelle finds “help” scratched into a window and with traces of blood. She also finds earrings that are identical to the ones in the photo. While neither Michelle nor Emmett confront Howard directly about this, it is revealed that Megan was kidnapped from a local high school. This revelation leads the two to believe that Howard is the one who kidnapped Megan, and not that Megan was kidnapped from Howard. <br>Therefore, it is worth analyzing Howard as an experienced kidnapper and seeing similarities between studies by psychoanalysts on kidnappers and rapists, and their portrayal on screen in 10. <br>Beginning with early psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud famously and controversially argued that events experienced by women such as kidnapping and rape, are partially self perpetuated by those seeking to repeat past traumas (Freud, 1896). More modern psychoanalytic studies have expanded on this notion to focus on the male psyche when committing these horrific acts. A 1971 study led by Dr. Murray L Cohen determined four classifications of rapists through different motives. They are (1) intense sexual motives, (2) rape a defense against homosexual wishes, (3) expression of hatred towards women, and (4) general predatory disposition that is not driven by hateful or sexual desires (Cohen et. al. 1971)<br>It is safe to rule out motive #2 as there is little indication Howard is gay, and moreover that the motive itself has more than likely been disproved over the years. Beginning with motive #1, there is evidence for Howard being sexually frustrated. He is middle-aged, unmarried, and has been obsessed with building a bomb shelter for years following the supposed death of his daughter. He is obese, and uses his size as a vehicle for intimidation. In combination with his aggression towards Michelle, especially in comparison to his relationship with Emmett, I would argue that Howard can be categorized as an involuntary celibate. He blames women for his celibacy when in reality he is the one at fault. Given this, Howard is most likely a combination of motives #1 and #3, sexual, and hatred towards women. <br>An example of Howard’s aggression towards women can be seen in the now infamous dinner scene. In this scene, Howard has just let Michelle out of her cell after explaining the situation to her. <br>The scene opens with a sexist remark. Howard says “As cooks go, I’m OK. Not great, but OK. Megan was a good cook. You’ll learn to love cooking.” The latter sentence is directed at Michelle. This is said despite Emmett also being at the table, meaning Howard is pushing his captives into the roles which he d<br>efines. Michelle as his wife, and Emmett possibly as their son. <br>The scene continues with Emmett mocking Howard’s cooking by sarcastically calling it the best pasta he has ever had given the circumstances. Howard calmly responds with “That’s not a bad point” then chastises him for using foul language at the table. This tells us that Howard looks down on Emmett, and yet has more patience with him than with Michelle as we will see in a moment. <br>Emmett goes on a tangent about wishing he had gotten more tattoos before the world ended. Howard is silent and unmoving until Michelle chuckles in reaction to Emmett making a joke about getting “YOLO” on his forehead. Howard immediately turns to Michelle and glares at her disapprovingly. This can be perceived a number of ways, two of which being that he thinks the two are being flirtatious, breaking his defined roles for them, and the other that he disapproves of Michelle’s happiness at all. Regarding the latter, Howard’s demeanor is serious at all times except when he himself is talking. This implies that he is only comfortable when he is in control. <br>This is further supported when Emmett suggests the idea of them starting a long game of Risk to pass the time. As soon as Howard gets the feeling that Emmett will continue talking, as he had before, he interrupts and commands him to stop talking. He says neither he nor Michelle appreciate Emmett’s humor. He speaks for Michelle without her giving any indication that she has a preference. <br>Michelle then tests Howard's patience by flirting outright with Emmett. She grazes her hand on Emmett’s when asking for the pepper, and upon taking it from Emmett, Howard lashes out and corners her against the wall, yelling at only her for disrespecting him. Howard does not yell at Emmett even though he had caught on and was obviously trying to anger Howard as much as Michelle was. <br>We can infer from this scene that Howard does not like having his preferences threatened. He feels as though Emmett and Michelle are taking advantage of him, and should be subservient to him in return for saving their lives. This supports the hypothesis that Howard is truly ill-intentioned and a rapist, kidnapper, and murderer, given the observations discussed in the aforementioned 1971 study. <br>A definitive similarity between Howard and the descriptions posed in the journal is the presence of Explosive Personality Disorder, more commonly referred to as Intermittent Explosive Disorder (to be referred to as IED)(Cohen et al., 1971). IED is most present within motives #3 and #4 (sexist hatred and rape-aggression diffusion). Signs of EPD include disproportionately violent responses to situations, such as what Howard expressed at the end of the dinner scene (Coccaro, 2010). <br>Another disorder common in rapists with a sexist motive is Antisocial Personality Disorder (Cohen et al., 1971). Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by the disregard for social norms and morals (Benjamin, 1996). Returning the claim that Howard is an involuntary celibate, this description is well supported. Being antisocial may have forced Howard into solidarity, hence pushing him to commit unspeakable acts to satisfy his sick, sexual, sadistic desires with Megan, should that theory be correct. <br>Before moving on to reasons for why Howard can be perceived as in the right, it is worth concluding that he is clearly a flawed character. For the reasons previously stated, Howard is not dealing with the apocalypse well. He is stressed, has a short temper, and of course, may have kidnapped, raped, and killed an innocent teenager. Howard may be physically prepared for the apocalypse, but certainly not fully prepared mentally. Granted, who would be?<br>Defending Howard is like playing the devil’s advocate, at least superficially given that we see the events of the film through the perspective of Michelle. For that reason, it is important to take her and Emmett’s fear out of consideration, and look at Howard’s actions from his own perspective and worldview.<br> Howard is a seasoned doomsday prepper and survivalist. Preppers are characterized as paranoid people who will do whatever necessary to stay alive (McGraw et al., 1986). In pop culture, reality shows such as Doomsday Preppers profit off of the exploitation of this paranoia.  Some go as far as to describe modern preppers as “...today's zeitgeist of fear of a world-changing event” (McNamara, 2013). However, in such shows and media, few survivalists are as prepared as Howard. He claims to be fully stocked for over two years without ever needing to leave the bunker. <br>A 1986 study determined the reasons different groups had for preparing for disaster. The groups questioned were self identifying activists, survivalists, and members of the general public who did not describe themselves as either. The study determined that activists were more focused on war preventability, while survivalists were significantly more concerned with war survivability, at a rate of over twice that of the general public (McGraw, 1986). Given these two quantitative and qualitative descriptions of preppers, we can infer that not only is Howard a survivalist, but he is likely in the top tier of preppers regarding effort and investment in survivability. <br>Given the nature of the physical space the film takes place in, as well as the oppression Howard inflicts on his captives, it is worth taking the concept of biopower into consideration. By cross-examining the micro-politics within the shelter with biopower as expressed by nations, we can better analyze Howard’s intentions and payoffs from his actions.<br> Social theorists argue that because the body is the only physical, real, and essential part of the human, institutions focus on human survival above all else (Neroni, 2015). This reflects the sole institution in the bunker in 10. Of which, Howard, a paranoid survivalist who will do anything to survive, is the only one in charge. Therefore, it makes sense that Howard will take whatever precautions to ensure his survival following the disaster, just as he took all the necessary precautions to survive prior to it. <br>This can be seen once again at the end of the dinner scene. Howard saw a threat to civility within the bunker, and extinguished it with force. In a group of three, regardless of the external circumstances, two people engaging in sex or romance creates tension within the trio. The tension is often a product of jealousy, uncomfort, or awkwardness. Michelle and Emmett becoming involved would be even more dangerous given that they are all locked in a small room for potentially years. <br>But of course, Howard had prepared for this possibility already. Shortly realizing that Howard may be the one to have kidnapped Megan, Emmett and Michelle begin to construct biohazard suits in secret. When noticing some tools and materials were missing, Howard confronts the two. The following is another close scene analysis of this interaction. <br>Howard initiates the interaction by giving very little information to the two with what the talk was going to be about. He opens a hidden cabinet, pulls out a barrel, and asks the two to pull it into the bathroom. When they ask what it is, Howard responds with “A barrel”. He gives such little information as both a way to intimidate the two, and also to hide any indication that he was prepared to kill them should the catch on and fight him. <br>In the bathroom, the three are standing around the barrel. Howard opens it and states that it is pyloric acid and can dissolve all biomatter on contact. He then pulls out the stolen tools and materials. Michelle and Emmett play dumb, trying to hide the fact that they have been planning to escape. Howard then drops the tools and materials in the acid, showing the highly corrosive properties. He asks “Do you think I’m an idiot?”, facing and speaking to Emmett. It is most likely that when push comes to shove, Howard perceives Emmett as a greater threat to him than Michelle, hence why he faces him rather than her. <br>The two fess up, realizing that Howard knows about their plan. It is worth noting that Howard also has a gun on his hip, and Michelle and Emmett are unarmed. Emmett lies and tells Howard that he was making a weapon so that he could get the gun from Howard, and then use it to make Michelle respect him as she does Howard. He says this to both save Michelle should things go south, and as a compliment to Howard. Howard thanks Emmett for his honesty, and promptly shoots him in the head. <br>Howard’s next actions are the most revealing. Michelle is clearly distraught, and Howard corners her, hugs her, and tells her that he had to do it so they could be safe. In this scene, he extinguishes the threat to the greatest extent, and with maximum precaution. Problem is, he lets out the line that “This is the way it was meant to be” which may imply that he had planned to kidnap and rape a woman all along. <br>Before delving further into drawing final conclusions about Howard, biopower played a large role in the pyloric acid scene. First, Howard uses a threat to their bodies as a response to the threat they pose to his world and order. Moreover, while nothing graphic is shown, Howard wanted to at least get the two to respond to the acid the same way audiences respond to body horror. While still discussing the possibility of Howard as a savior, he exhibits sadistic perversions in this scene. The sadist in him wants to instill fear in Michelle and Emmett through anxiety, and the potential of pain (Neroni, 2015). <br>Howard in 10 Cloverfield Lane is complicated in that he survived against all odds, and saved two people from certain death. Yet, his precautionary tendencies have not faded post-disaster, causing him to take drastic measures to keep his fellow survivors in line, and alive. However, while Howard’s morals are in the right place, and he is well intentioned in that he wants what is best for humanity’s survival, his judgment is clouded by the paranoia of his own mortality. For this reason, we can conclude that Howard is in fact the true enemy of 10. Michelle and Emmett had their lives saved by Howard, but all of their survival depended on his ability to live peacefully, not within a perfect world. His fatal flaw is that he did everything in his power to make reality what he wanted it to be, rather than what was best for Michelle and Emmett as individuals.

                <h2>Contemporary BIPOC Representation in Mediae</h2>
                <p><em>Originally published in the VTPOC newsletter, May 31, 2023 </em><br>We all know the representation matters.  Unfortunately, there still remains immense backlash when major companies  like Walt Disney work to improve racial representation in their  productions. Outrage from the right wing about non-white, male, cis/het  casting could be seen as far back as 2009 when attempts to write BIPOC  leading roles were first made by the company in The Princess and the  Frog. More recent examples include Disney casting Daisy Ridley, a woman,  as the lead in the latest Star Wars trilogy in 2015, along with BIPOC  costars John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran. All three actors received an  incalculable amount of online hate simply for reading their scripts,  prompting them to deactivate social media for a period of time.<br>Disney’s  latest push for representation comes in the form of a live action  remake for The Little Mermaid, releasing May 26. Black singer and  actress Halle Bailey was cast as Ariel, whose original depiction in  literature and in the 1994 animated film was as a pale Danish girl. This  led to a firestorm on social media – 2 million dislikes on Youtube and  comments claiming white erasure from right-wing extremists? But it’s the  implications of this movie on the next generation of young Black people  that matter most. The representation of diverse identities in media is  crucial for promoting inclusivity and understanding in the real world. <br>The  emergence of Rap in the late 80s and early 90s and  Hip-hop music in  the late 90s have  significant players in BIPOC artists being able to  express themselves and be heard by other communities. The genres began  as a response to the lack of representation and positive portrayal of  Black and Latino communities in mainstream media, and provide a platform  for artists to share their lived experiences from their perspectives.  The influence of hip-hop has expanded beyond just music, and has become a  cultural phenomenon that has had a real impact on shaping the  representation of BIPOC identities globally, for the better. <br>However,  casting a Black actress as a historically white character does not  relay the BIPOC experience as clearly as in music, especially when the  film is written and directed by white people. In the case of The Little  Mermaid, though, that is not really the point. Critics claim Bailey’s  casting was an unnecessary change to appeal to a liberal audience, and  while you can’t put that past Disney, there’s no doubt that she appears  to fit the role well. In the case of fantasy genres, casting should  prioritize actors who can best fit the character, not the character’s  appearance. Unnecessary outrage about a BIPOC actor being cast in a  historically white role in fantasy genres is baseless and ultimately  counterproductive to promoting diversity and inclusivity in media.<br>It  would also be absurd to not acknowledge the modern critical dogma, or  belief, of the fairytale as an allegory for the struggles of queerness  in Denmark when the story was first published by Hans Christian Andersen  in 1836. Not including research into the author’s personal life and  letters, it tells the story of a character forcefully separated from the  rest of humanity which she desperately wants to be a part of. She’s put  in a position in which she has to hide her true self to be accepted,  and eventually dies because she’s not able to bridge the divide. If this  reading is as intended, then it’s the 1994 adaptation that strays  further from the source material than the 2023 remake does from its  own. <br>In a recent series of interviews VT  PoC conducted, Vermont based BIPOC artists were asked to share their  thoughts on the subject of media representation of artists and actors of  color. Poet, speaker, and activist Rajnii Eddins urged the BIPOC  community to take the higher ground. He commented:<br>“We [as BIPOC]  play a pivotal role in modeling what true humanity can look like. By  humanizing, sensitizing, and holding space for even those who don’t  respect us… [Critic’s] insecurity keeps us from having our true  contributions being shown. It stops us from having representation in any  capacity. ”<br>The spotlight article for the  month of May also focuses on Bennington-based visual artist Ahmad  Yassir, who emphasized the importance of resilience in the face of  discrimination. Ahmad stated: “It’s important to approach any challenges  or barriers with a sense of resilience and determination. As a BIPOC  individual, it may be necessary to advocate for oneself and seek out  opportunities that may not be immediately apparent. However, by building  strong relationships with the local community and actively pursuing  one’s goals, it is possible to thrive and make a positive impact in  Vermont.” You can read more on our conversation with Ahmad in our  upcoming spotlight article on him and his work.

                <h2>A Vermonter’s Political Power</h2>
                <p><em>Originally published in the VTPOC Newsletter, Feb 28, 2023</em><br>Vermont as a whole has a unique and special relationship to democracy  compared to other states. For starters, the state has the fifth highest  voter turnout rate in the country in presidential elections, with 71.8%  of Vermonters participating, compared to the national average of   61.4%. Meanwhile, Vermont voters have the second highest voting power in  the United States Senate, with one senator per 323,000 people compared  to the country’s average of 1 senator per 3.33 million people. That  trend persists in the electoral college as well. <br>The power that  residents of this small state have to influence the country as a whole  cannot be understated, however local elections are just as, if not more  important to influencing the voter’s own quality of life. Yet voter  turnout for local elections are minimal compared to that of federal and  state elections. In the 2022 Burlington election for city counselors,  the average voter turnout across the eight wards was only 29.1%. While  it’d be difficult to compare, one can infer that this is still higher  than the turnout in the average American city. That being said, there is  still an obvious divide between willingness and ability to vote in  local versus federal elections that needs to be addressed. <br>Increasing  voter turnout in local elections is not an easy task. Whereas it is  easy to get people excited for federal elections, local elections are  not nearly as flashy. Especially in a small state like Vermont, there is  little news coverage, or even word-of-mouth, for what is being voted  for, why it matters, and who even wins. An unfortunate example can be  seen as recently as this past year. In the March 2022 Burlington city  elections, five questions were asked of the public to help decide public  policy. These questions ranged from a simple approval of local school  budgets, to the deregulation of sex workers by the city. Without a voter  regularly watching city council session broadcasts or attending  Neighborhood Planning Association meetings, chances are that most voters  learned about these issues at their polling station. Furthermore, it  gives rise to the issue of accessibility, with the verbiage used being  difficult for many native English speakers, let alone a new American. <br>For  instance, the official results for the March 2022 election simply list  question three as “Authorization to issue general obligations bonds for  capital projects”. This is too broad to actually make inferences into  what the issue tackled. What the voter was actually expected to respond  to was a wordy summary that only lists three  specific pieces of  information: 23 million dollars, fire trucks, and sidewalks. While the  City of Burlington makes a solid, appreciated effort to provide  residents direct democracy for issues like those proposed in this  election cycle, it’s clearly unreasonable for a voter to be expected to  respond to a topic like this with no information beyond the 175 words  provided on the ballot. This particular question was both too vague for  most voters to make an informed decision on, and yet decided the fate  for more money than most would ever see in their lives. It’s questions  like these that turn some people off to voting all together, and a more  concerted effort can be made to inform residents about the pros and cons  of this issue before they cast their vote. <br>The March 2021  Burlington city elections looked vastly different from the four  complicated fiscal questions proposed in 2022 (the concise, social  policy question that deregulates sex work notwithstanding). The  questions proposed to voters in 2021 were more plentiful, focused on  mainly social issues, were stated concisely, and most importantly, made  large, positive impacts that would directly affect the lives of  residents. One that stood out as being pertinent to the BIPOC community  was question 5, which limited evictions to “just cause” only – enforcing  housing security for renters. While the city of Burlington does not  have home ownership rates for all BIPOC identifying residents, data  indicates that 98% of Black Burlington-ians are renters. When contrasted  with the White renter rate of just 58%, it is easy to see why question 5  was so important to approve, and why a high BIPOC turnout rate for  local elections are oftentimes more important and/or dire than other  demographics. <br>Language and information barriers aside, more towns  and cities in Vermont can make stronger efforts to encourage voting in  local elections. Winooski and Montpelier have decided to push notions of  local elections away from the procedures and restrictions present in  federal elections and more so onto community engagement via an  “All-Resident” voting policy. This policy permits residents of their  city to vote in local elections regardless of citizenship. Doing so  allows the roughly 10% of non-US Citizen residents of Winooski, and 2%  of non-citizen Montpelier residents, to participate and help shape their  community without needing to complete the often drawn out and tiring  naturalization process. <br>Lastly it’s important to remind oneself  that local elections do not only decide local policies, but also  determine who makes all  the decisions that don’t appear on the ballot.  Only 10 of the 155 representatives in the Vermont State Legislature  identify as BIPOC. Electing BIPOC representatives of color can be the  first step in mending wounds seen in historically marginalized  communities, as they may be better addressed by someone who has walked  in those resident’s shoes.

                <h2>Time Loops, Escapism, and Minit</h2>
                <p><em>Originally written for Literary Theory at the University of Vermont</em><br>Over the course of four years in college, I found myself gradually become less and less interested in what used to be my favorite hobby. Video games, in general, used to be not only my go to activity in my spare time, but the industry was also one I aspired to work in as a career. I have distinct memories of faking being sick in middle school only to spend all day on the couch completing questlines in Skyrim while my parents were at work; it was the only time I was able to play for that long in one sitting. Non-narrative games like Minecraft, and any number of multiplayer shooters saw that habit continue consistently through my teenage years. However, like many students, there comes a time when you have to put your hobbies and habits on the back burner in place of you studies. Often times, those habits might fade away and become something you can only relive in memories. After a good couple years of thinking video games were something I grew out of, Minit (2018) drew me back in, and showed me that it is possible to present them in new ways. <br>Minit takes around two hours to finish. It cost $5 at launch, and has art direction shooting for  a step above Pong (1972). It’s music is repetitive, and the core, defining mechanic is a simple twist on the plot famous film Groundhog Day (1993). Despite this underwhelming description, Minit is able to make bold statements through its careful choices within its gameplay, repetition, and procedures. The gameplay of Minit naturalizes a nearly universal part of video games; a part which is used exclusively as a penalty. Death in games are core to much of their appeal. The most grandiose escapism is the incorporation of such. The naturalization of being forced to die in Minit changes death in a video game from being a penalty, into a utility to learn from your mistakes than in a shooter or other timed challenge. When made procedural, death becomes something useful rather than something to avoid. <br>To explain how Minit does this, it is important to define procedures in the context of video games. Game critic Ian Bogost, author of the highly influential book Persuasive Games is the founder of the concept of procedural rhetoric. The following description of this concept was learned from Chapter 1 of his book Persuasive Games (titled “Procedural Rhetoric) as well as his article “The Rhetoric of Video Games” which was published a year later, and expands on the topic. <br>Bogost describes both procedures in the context of video games, and how they differ from themselves when  in combination with rhetoric. Procedures, in the context of computers, refer to the machine’s ability to execute a series of rules (Bogost, Persuasive Games 6). Rhetoric, on the other hand, refers to the art of persuasion, most commonly through spoken word. Procedural Rhetoric, then, refers to the ability to persuade the viewer, reader, or player through the execution of processes, whether they be procedures executed by the player or the machine. Hence, Bogost theorizes that this concept is specific to video games in that they are the only medium where the experience is always tied to the machine executing said processes, or rules. Moreover, games are creative mediums in which tasks, executed by the player, are repeated over and over again. This differs from other forms of entertainment in that they do not allow the viewer or reader’s input. Input in this context refers to the literal pressing of buttons, rather than the creation of discourse like in a professional setting. This form of input is the primary differentiating factor between persuasion in games and persuasion in films, books, music, or other mediums. <br>Another useful concept introduced in his article “Rhetoric in Video Games” is the Possibility Space. Possibility space refers to the freedom within an environment following recognition of its constraints, or rules. Bogost uses the example of poetic constraints to better define this. <br>“By designing the rules of literary composition, Oulipian writers share much in common with children on a playground: first they create a possibility space, then they fill that space with meaning by exploring the free movement within the rigid structure of literary rules.” (Bogost, Rhetoric of Video Games 121)<br>Understanding how video games simulate certain environments, and how they make interactions within them persuasive, are critical to understanding procedural rhetoric as a whole. This is because procedural rhetoric relies primarily on the ability for a game to convey messages through those spaces and processes. Like constraints dictated by poetic forms, the simulation of an environment dictates the constraints that procedures operate within to create meaning. The player only has input on the simulation, therefore, the video games are unique in that they can convey messages only if the player repeats a task they are persuaded to complete. <br>Before applying these forms of analysis in gaming to Minit, there is one other concept specific to its narrative and form that are worth taking into account. <br>Lacanian death drive relates to the core mechanic that differentiates Minit from other games. The story begins with the character picking up a cursed sword which causes them to die every 60 seconds, and restart from they picked it up. While it is not a complete reset of the game (some tools they pick up can be kept in their inventory even after they die) it still forces the player to return to where they began. By the end of the game, the player should have learned enough about the world be able to defeat the final enemy in 60 seconds. <br>Death plays a pivotal role in Minit’s gameplay. Unlike many other games, death is no longer a penalty. In fact, it becomes a tool. Jacques Lacan’s further writings on death drive differs from that of Freud’s in that he sees little difference between death drives and sexual drives (Lacan, 432). <br>In his 1920 essay Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud introduces the death drive as distinctly different from sexual drives. This is due primarily to his original theorization arguing that they are relating to the masochistic and disturbed (Freud, 9).  In 1939’s Ecrits, Lacan connects sexual drives and death drives as one in the same. He introduces the French word for orgasm, “Jouissance”, to demonstrate this. “Jouissance”, in french, refers to both the orgasm and enjoyment in general. What is somewhat paradoxical about this, is that it is the orgasm is end of sexual desire. Human beings desire an end to their enjoyment, an end to sex. In Ecrits, Lacan writes:<br>“In his Beyond, Freud makes room for the fact that the pleasure principle —to which he has, in sum, given a new meaning by instating its signifying articulation of repetition in the circuit of reality, in the form of the primary process—takes on a still newer meaning by helping force open its traditional barrier related to a jouissance, a jouissance that is pinpointed at that time in masochism, and even opens onto [the question of] the death drive.” (Lacan, 9)<br>Lacan thus is arguing that the orgasm is inherently masochistic, in that our drives, sexual or otherwise, always seek an end to desire. The ultimate end to desire, then, is death. <br>So how does any of this relate to Minit? Returning to its defining mechanic: the curse prevents the end to desire. Through various puzzles and challenges around the world, the game makes small arguments that show how the language of games can convey messages without any story at all. The story, then, serves as the possibility space as much as the actual map does. Both contribute to the ability for the player to learn from the procedures they execute.<br>This leads me to begin by commending the game’s first subversion of escapist tropes; the effects on pacing. Pacing in games are always a challenge to developers. People who play games are accustomed to always being entertained, because in most games you can leave and do something else in the world if you ever get bored. The nature of the curse then gives rise to another obstacle besides being forced to restart; the game times your lives. <br>The procedure of having timed lives is a direct example of how procedurality can be rhetorical. Minit is a simple game. While it gives the player an open world to explore, they only have a couple story-driven goals to work towards within it. The core mechanic creates more, smaller goals for the player, as well as making them work towards them with more intensity. <br>To demonstrate this, I propose the utility of one of the first puzzles the player is supposed to solve in the game. To the west of the starting house, there is an old man sitting at the base of a lighthouse. He talks very slowly, and there is no way for the player to speed up the text. When the player first arrives, they listen to the old man for a few seconds and realize he is giving directions. However, he is speaking so slowly that the player dies before he finishes telling them where to go. The player solves the puzzle by learning that they will need to value their time and rush to certain objectives as soon as they respawn. This reminds and persuades the player to not only rush to their objective, but also to be patient once they have correctly allocated their sixty seconds. It is a simple message, but it is effective in its delivery and serves as a good invisible tutorial for the beginning of the game.<br>There is a valid argument to be made in favor of this being a narrative-driven form of rhetoric, but I argue for the opposite. On the surface, yes, the developers intended for the story to progress such that the character learns to go straight to the lighthouse and listen to the man’s directions. But is it not the player learning to do this from the rules of the game before the character learns to do so? <br>The case of the old man at the lighthouse gives rise to the question of how, or why, dying is made rhetorical. Deconstructing death in games are often simple. As previously acknowledged, death is almost always used as a penalty. In a shooter like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) dying is a penalty which cannot be used to one's advantage; if you get shot, you respawn somewhere else and try to shoot others and score more points. You cannot die and choose to respawn at an enemy’s back, or from a strategic position. The rhetoric of those sorts of games persuade the player into staying safe. <br>A psychoanalytic reading of a multiplayer shooter might exemplify the difference between Freud and Lacan’s theorization of drives. Multiplayer games are meant to be fun, yet they have limits that, when met, end the game. Therefore the goal of the player is to reach that limit. They do so by doing things that prove to be somewhat cathartic to players, yet the objective to end the game remains. The death drive, the drive to end something that is satisfying a drive, plays the role of keeping the players hooked while at the same time, concluding that catharsis.<br>Minit takes away a few factors from this now-traditional formula in games. First, the sixty second life limit takes away the fairness in dying. You aren’t shot by someone better at shooting than you are at dodging, you weren’t poisoned by your own neglect. You have no control over your death. So how do the mechanics in Minit satisfy death drives? Answer: it doesn’t. I argue that, while psychoanalysis has generally come to agree on Lacan’s parallels between sex and death drives, Minit operates from an almost Freudian perspective in which the sexual and destructive drives are separate from one another. It is from this perspective that changes the core mechanic of dying into something useful. <br>To demonstrate, I propose taking a closer look at a puzzle from later in the game. The final enemy of the game is the CEO of the evil corporation that had both been polluting waters near your home, and manufacturing cursed swords. There are multiple parts to this challenge, all of which speak to the Freudian analysis of the death drive. The first challenge in the company’s headquarters is a long hallway. In a regular game, a hallway would not phase the player; they would simply walk down it and continue. In Minit, the hallway itself is as much of an enemy as a guard would be. Health and time are similar in that both need to be saved and protected. To get around this, the player must either find shoes that make them run faster, or find another path to the CEO. The latter would require the player to allocate the rest of their time to searching the facility. If they succeed, they will still die. However, death here is made useful because they can respawn with a full sixty seconds and walk the correct path.  <br>Protection of time as health speaks to Freud’s conception of the death drive as it gives rise to a nihilistic view of life and death. In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud writes:<br>“So through a long period of time the living substance may have been constantly created anew, and easily extinguished, until decisive external influences altered in such a way as to compel the still surviving substance to ever greater deviations from the original path of life, and to ever more complicated and circuitous routes to the attainment of the goal of death.” (Freud, 31)<br>Here, Freud is speaking on changes in human history that increased our lifespan, and made us more aware of our health and what we want from death. The industrial revolutions, for example, allowed humanity to not only expect a longer life, but have a more enjoyable one at that. The extension of one's lifespan by means of technology operates in the same way Minit does. In Minit, when made hyperware of your shrinking lifespan, you take less leisure in your actions. It is because of that awareness that you work harder. That awareness makes your life more productive- the procedural escapism of having the ability to respawn makes your death useful. <br>Minit may not be the most refined, beautiful, or impactful puzzle game, though it’s procedures serve as an interesting text to examine from a psychoanalytic perspective. When death is made a non-punishing procedure, it allows for the player to take notice of how they play. When their life has a countdown, they think faster, act faster, and learn to make decisions better. The hallway, for example, poses as much of a threat as an enemy would. The player uses their death, not necessarily as a physical tool here, but as a utility to force better decision making. The death drive in Minit operates from a Freudian perspective, where the cathartic trade off with dying is eliminated, and dying serves as a punishment that the player slowly manipulates into motivation.</p>

                <h2>Velvet Buzzsaw Review & Freudian Analysis</h2>
                <p><em>Originally written for Horror and Psychoanalysis at the University of Vermont</em><br>Velvet Buzzsaw, in the context of 2019 horror cinema, is a desperate cry for originality within the genre, while critically failing at nearly every tear it sheds. The film is filled to the brim with what should be one of the most creative plots and story structures for a horror movie in this decade. Unfortunately, inconsistent acting, poor pacing, awkward editing, and the overlooked use of genre tropes, bog it down like a ball and chain in an Olympic sprint. Despite this, Velvet Buzzsaw is still worth analysis. By wading through the imperfections in its final release, genre fans will find a unique horror-mystery story with interesting characters and surprises. Furthermore, the central idea which the film revolves around raises important questions about the role of art in a desensitized world. Velvet Buzzsaw seeks to critique the worth people place on beauty that is not theirs to value. <br> Writer and director Dan Gilroy was riding off the high of his 2014 hit Nightcrawler, his directorial debut. Gilroy had had a long career as a screenwriter before 2014, writing The Bourne Legacy (2012), Real Steel (2011), and The Fall (2006), none of which were well well received by critics . Nightcrawler turned his career around almost immediately. He began writing his next two scripts; Roman J Israel, Esq. (2017) and Kong: Skull Island (2017) (Collider, 2019). The former, which he directed, was described by Odie Henderson, reviewer at Roger Ebert, as “Prime Oscar bait” and was given 1/4 stars (Henderson, 2017). This was despite a leading role from Oscar winner Denzel Washington and supporting actor, Golden Globe winner Colin Farrell. Kong: Skull Island was co-written by Gilroy and ended up being a very well received action-comedy, if not slightly forgettable two years on with the fizzling-out of the Universal Dark Universe (Godzilla (2014), Kong (2017), the Mummy (2017)) (Chapman, 2019). Gilroy revived the plot for Velvet Buzzsaw after tabling it since 1998. Then, he had been writing Superman Lives, which was scrapped by Warner Bros. over a year into pre-production following a $190 million budget request. Gilroy continued writing through the 2000s, and did not get the chance to produce Velvet Buzzsaw until 2018, when Netflix reached out to him following the success of Nightcrawler (Collider, 2019). Netflix was able to attach some big names to the project as well, including Toni Collette, Natalia Dyer, and John Malkovich. Gilroy also brought on Jake Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo to play the leads, having worked with both in the past as leads in Nightcrawler. Along with a generous $21 million budget, Gilroy had his film, 20 years in the making. <br> Sadly, the film was not well received. It was panned by critics for having unusual pacing, inconsistent acting, and falling victim to genre tropes, of which will be explored further in this paper. The film currently sits with a 65% aggregate score on Rotten Tomatoes and a 5.8 user score on IMDb with 28,000 reviews. It is also worth comparing Velvet Buzzsaw to Bird Box (2018), the most ambitious film produced and distributed by Netflix, which happened to also be a horror with big names attached, and came out just two months prior. Bird Box was generally liked by both audiences and critics, sitting at 62% on Rotten Tomatoes and 6.7 on IMDb user reviews. The film was actually made with a budget of about $2 million less than Buzzsaw, yet was shot much more creatively, and had a more consistent lead (CFC, 2017). In addition, the story was simple, and had fewer characters, compared to Buzzsaw’s eight major supporting characters. Bird Box is the most successful movie in Netflix’s history, with over 45 million viewers in the first week (Alexander, 2018). Alongside a knockout trailer, viewers had high expectations for the next Netflix-produced feature film, which may have played a role in the disappointing critical and aggregate responses.<br> Yet the film still has a lot to offer. The narrative is simple, if not a bit laughable at points. An art curator finds a dead man in her apartment. Upon inspecting the man’s unit, she finds hundreds of paintings, all of which are haunting, and portray the mind in pain and turmoil. Despite the artist’s wishes to have them destroyed, she takes these paintings and passes herself off as a representative of an anonymous artist. The paintings then end up being - literally - haunted by the dead artist, and their new owners are killed off, final destination style. The lead named Morf (Gyllenhaal), an art critic who finds himself infatuated with the paintings. He and his fellow critics and curators are among the victims. The film looks to question whether it was right of the woman, Josephina, to take the paintings (Gilroy, 2019). Should she destroy the paintings after finding out about the wishes of the deceased, or should she share them further to show the world the man’s talent - and make herself rich in the process?<br> There is a lot to take into consideration when looking at Velvet Buzzsaw through a psychoanalytic lens. Immediately, Sigmund Freud’s 1908 essay Creative Writers and Daydreaming comes to mind. As the plot summary suggests, art and creative expression play central roles in the story and character’s interactions. Freud suggests that artists draw upon daydreams from their childhood for inspiration, and combined with aesthetic technique, is what creates art. Childhood daydreams are left in the sub or preconscious until adulthood when it is acceptable for them to be revived, realized, and made physical (Freud, 1908). This concept was exactly addressed in Buzzsaw. Upon the discovery of the artist’s work through Josephina, Morf researches the artist. He finds that the artist, named Vetril Dease, grew up in an abusive household, to the point where he eventually rebelled and murdered his father. While the film does little to show this through its characters, the prop artworks used were designed to show scenes of despair and agony. Eyes are often either wide, showing shock and/or disgust, or shut tight as to avoid something, or more effectively, to scream. The painting much of the first half of the film focused on shows a young girl screaming with her hands in the air, while a boy, slightly older, punches a man who is just trying to defend himself. While a bit too on-the-nose, the production designers showed the artist’s inspiration through his work the same way Freud would have predicted, even without Dease ever saying a word. Furthermore, the application of Creative Writers and Daydreaming’s ideas here revolve back to the idea Buzzsaw is attempting to critique. Who is the viewer to experience one’s subconscious? Regardless of whether or not Dease wanted the paintings destroyed, showing any piece of art gives insight into the artist’s mind. Do the buyers of the paintings deserve to experience this? By killing off these characters, Dan Gilroy thinks not. <br> When speaking of art in a psychoanalytic context, it is safe to take into account Sigmund Freud’s On Transience. Transience is the state of being impermanent. This can be applied to anything, from a person who will die, to a painting that will eventually be destroyed somehow, to the Earth itself, which will be consumed by the sun millions of years from now. Art plays a huge role in Freud’s original 1915 essay. In it, he describes a scene where he is walking with his friend, a poet. The poet, an artist, is disheartened by the realization that everything is prone to death (Freud, 1915). <br> Transience plays a big role in Buzzsaw for similar reasons. The central conflict is between Dease, and the curators. Dease, having wanted his works destroyed, lives with the knowledge that everything will end. The curators, attempt to defy and rebel against this. Freud acknowledges both these perspectives in his paper. Dease is on the side of the poet; unable to see beauty because of its impermanence. The curators are on Freud’s side, that being, transience increases the worth of beauty. Of course, like in any horror movie, the rebellion against nature comes with consequences, even if Freud and the Curators are the optimists in this case. Hence why those defying the wishes of the dead, and in turn the laws of nature, are killed off. <br> As explained previously, Velvet Buzzsaw uses death as a means for revenge on behalf of Vetril Dease, as well as a way of arguing against placing value on beauty you don’t have any right to. It only seems natural to take into consideration Freud’s 1918 essay Our Attitude Towards Death. In this paper, Freud examines general reactions by populations to deaths. These include death of a loved one, enemy, stranger, and those who commit suicide. For example, when examining reactions to death of enemies, man remains unconcerned. That is, unless they themselves are tasked with doing the killing, in which moral judgement would play a greater role (Freud, 1918). <br> The ideas from this paper are most present in the events following a character’s death. The death of the art curator, Gretchen (Collette), stands out in particular. The scene begins with Gretchen, alone, in the City Gallery, the most popular gallery in the area. The lights are off, with the exception of a single spotlight over one exhibit. The work is a chrome sphere with three holes in it. The viewer puts their hand in one of the holes, and the “art” is what you feel inside. Supposedly in the near future, technology allows us to create any texture or crude object we want. <br> As she approaches the sphere, the viewer is shown one of Buzzsaw’s few artistic choices with depth. The camera follows closely behind Gretchen and centers on the sphere for a moment, opposed to Gretchen herself. The sphere, being chrome and mirror-like, gives the viewer a fisheye look of the scene behind them, encompassing the whole of the gallery space. This choice makes clear that she is alone. So much so that not even the camera can be seen in the mirror. <br> Before the action, there is a cut to one of Dease’s paintings on the wall. The camera pans in slowly on the faces of two faceless children, and eyes appear. This was used earlier in the film in another death scene, and is representative of the artist’s spirit coming for the sinners. Another cut brings the viewer back to the sphere, but inside a hole this time, looking out. Gretchen looks in, such that the shot is only of her face. This further emphasizes the unknown properties of the sphere and what is inside.<br> There are few cuts back and forth between her hand sliding further in the hole, and figures in Dease’s paintings (his works have a very distinct style using thick brushstrokes, so it is easy to tell when a new painting shown is his). Gretchen’s arm is now shoulder-deep in the hole. She is tugged a few times, and her expression changes. Finally, a light underneath the sphere turns red, and her arm is shredded like a wood chipper. She screams, and collapses. <br> Where Freud comes in, is in the aftermath of her death. The gallery opens the next morning, but nobody is phased by Gretchen’s body, or the massive pool of blood around her. People are seen walking around her and the sphere, as if to analyze and critique it. A group of children on a school field trip are even seen stepping in the blood. The twist: that visitors thought Gretchen’s body was a piece of art. <br> Freud’s paper, Our Attitude Towards Death, speaks to this scene immensely. It’s fairly obvious what the film is attempting to say with this scene. First, that Americans are desensitized to death and violence, and second, due to a bit about trending on social media following the incident, that people find value in shock- or going to extremes. Freud’s identification of different reactions to death fits this scene because of the relationship between the audience and the art. Unlike with the death of a loved one, the death of a stranger incited as much of an effect in primitive man than with the death of an enemy. According to Freud, the death of loved ones are the roots of guilt and ethical codes. The death of a stranger, however, can be as conceptualized by the primitive mind as the death of oneself can be conceptualized. Therefore we can infer that humans inherently go through the same thought process regarding the death of a stranger as when thinking about their own death; inconceivable by the subconscious (Freud, 1918). The viewers did not react to the body because, apart from the theme desensitization, their minds cannot conceive the death in that instance. Furthermore, this scene critiques the critics for misplacing value, as the scene is seen through the lens of those with a knowledge of ethical rights and wrongs in this situation; the audience themselves. <br> Velvet Buzzsaw may be one of the most complicated films on Netflix’s platform. On one hand, the film is aesthetically shallow, is a bore to sit through, and ruined any strand of greatness with awful post production oversight. On the other, it is unapologetically creative. Director Dan Gilroy took a risk with this film. He made a horror movie with bright colors, colorful characters, and an emphasis on art itself as the subject of discussion. Leads Jake Gyllenhaal and Zawe Ashton portray unique victims, struggling with the decision to fight libido with morals. It is doubtful another horror of this calibre will grace the pages of Netflix for years, and yet when it is all said and done, it is hard to argue that that is a bad thing.</p>

                <h2>Neoliberalism before Neoliberalism in <em>Come and See</em></h2>
                <p><em>Originally Written for South Korean Cinema at the University of Vermont</em><br>        The war genre in movies has and always will be prime media for art that conveys trauma. It is in the name. War movies show death, destruction, recovery. Actors have to exhibit the effects of loss, pain, and more often than not, subservience. A frequently shared narrative characteristic of these films, though, is the persistence of a hero character. This character is almost always the protagonist, and can include other characters as well. The prevalence begs the question: what would a war film look like without a hero, and how would it affect the representation of the events and the trauma conveyed? This question was answered in 1985 by Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov in Come and See. Like the war movie genre, Come and See wears its title bluntly. Through the eyes of a Belorusian teenager, Florya, the audience sees the often overlooked horrors of the second World War in Eastern Europe. Through his journey, however, Florya is never painted as a hero, nor is anyone around him. He is never saved, and he never saves. In this, Elem Klimov effectively demonstrates the inversion of freedom and sacrifice as produced by neoliberalism. Despite Come and See taking place in 1943, Klimov, perhaps involuntarily, critiques this symptom of his economy by showing a world that neither permits self nor governance. Moreover, Florya’s body serves as a host in showing said inversion. <br>Come and See critiques neoliberalism by showing the inversion of freedom and sacrifice on the body and mind of a teenager in World War II. In combination with a lawless, stateless environment, Klimov argues for a return to moral form in the present. <br>In the epilogue of her book Undoing the Demos: Neoliberalism’s Stealth Revolution, Wendy Brown argues that freedom has become sacrifice, and vice versa. For example, citizenship, an easy thing to acquire in the twentieth century, now is used to coax people into service and sacrificing for country over self. Even president John F. Kennedy supported this sentiment in 1961 with his famous quote “...ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country”. In response to this phenomena, Wendy Brown writes: <br>“Patriotism itself may be expressed in many ways, from radical criticism to slavish devotion, engaged activity to passive obedience. In all cases, however, its consummate sign is the willingness to risk life, which is why soldiers in battle remain its enduring icon and why Socrates rendered acceptance of his death sentence as ultimate proof of his loyalty to Athens and compared himself to a soldier when doing so. (Brown, 218)<br>In the beginning of Come and See, Florya is put in the same position Socrates was. He, a willing member of society, had a responsibility to defend his home once he was of age. However, Florya’s victimization by patriotism can be seen even earlier in the film. <br>The knowing and understanding the opening scene of Come and See is critical to following Florya’s journey and certain scenes later in the film. The film opens on Florya and his friend digging around in old trenches from the first world war which had since been filled with sand. Florya finds a working rifle, and is as excited as any child would be in his position following a major war. An old man passes by and warns them not to dig in the trenches. He points towards a plane in the sky above them- potentially watching. Florya ignores the man and takes the gun home anyways. When it is finally time for the able bodied men of his village to go to war, he thinks he is packed and ready. <br>I will return to the film and the ramifications of Florya’s decisions, but before doing so, let us return to Brown’s perspective on modern inscription, of which I thoroughly agree with. As with most things in the neoliberal world, people are now more than ever forced to make decisions under the threat of losing everything. Brown notes that thanks to fears of lifelong debt and unemployment, military service is an attractive option. This attractiveness is only amplified thanks to the privatization of once public goods, and the supposed return on one's sacrifice in the form of job security and the Veteran’s Association (in the United States). Alas you may be thinking to yourself “these are the 1940s!” A fair  argument against the association between neoliberal  and traditional inscription. Florya joins a militia not because of the threat of unemployment, but under threat of death in the first place. To that, a new shift has emerged that relates these two reasons for inscription: where joining a military was once done to defend oneself due to a lack of governance to protect them, neoliberal values have produced a world in which joining the military is done due to lack of governance protecting their wealth. This ties into the symptom that public goods are privatized under neoliberalism. Is unemployment as close to a death sentence today as an invasion was to Florya? To a twenty year old with tens of thousands of dollars in student debt, it may seem that way.<br>In that sense, neoliberal democratic societies which oppose fascism may mirror the very state of governance it was created to protect against, albeit being much more complicated. In the neoliberal world, state racism and antisemitism has been largely replaced by class warfare and the struggles of the proletariat. <br>I noticed the same convergences happening to Florya in Come and See. Throughout the film, he, as well as actor Aleksei Kravchenko, is repeatedly pushed down to the point of complete mental collapse. Represented as hate, the same fascism that destroyed his life envelops him in the final sequence: a montage of images of hitler and concentration camps in between shots Florya takes at a framed photo of the fuhrer laying in the mud. <br>Prior to this occurring, there were two scenes in the film that set Florya down this path. First, is the return of the old man from the opening scene. After warning him of not digging in the trenches, Florya’s village is inevitably bombed by the Germans. Upon returning, Florya finds many of his neighbors dead. One of the few survivors is the old man, unable to move due to burns covering his entire body. Florya blames himself for his village’s destruction and attempts to drown himself in a bog. This is the first major piece of trauma that is inflicted on his body, which adds to his break. The second and third pieces of evidence are different from each other. The scene just prior to Florya’s meltdown is trauma inflicted upon his character. There is another that inflicts trauma upon Aleksei Kravchenko.<br>Allow me to elaborate. Come and See is famed for inflicting genuine trauma on its actors, not unlike those in Kubrick’s The Shining. One of these examples comes from about midway through the film. Florya is crossing a field at night and is fired upon. He takes shelter behind a cow for about a full minute. Behind the scenes, Elem Klimov used live ammo. Aleksei ends the film covered in wrinkles from the stress, of which many speculate were not makeup. <br>Next, was the second to last scene of the film. Following Florya witnessing the burning of an entire town’s population, the militia captures a group of six nazi soldiers involved in the horrific murders. The leader of the militia gives the ranking nazi officer a can of gasoline and tells him to dowse his comrades with it or else he will be shot. The nazi does so, but is taken down by the other prisoners. All of them are burned alive as Florya watches on. However, Florya does not flinch, nor does he smile. He accepts their deaths as casualties of war, having grown numb to pain. In her book Unclaimed Experience, Cathy Caruth describes trauma as: <br>“...an overwhelming experience of sudden or catastrophic events in which the response to the event occurs in the often delayed, uncontrolled repetitive appearance of hallucinations and other intrusive phenomena. The experience of the soldier faced with sudden and massive death around him, for example, who suffers this sight in a numbed state, only to relive it later on in repeated nightmares, is a central and recurring image of trauma in our century.” (Caruth, 11)<br>My reason for providing this definition is to show the similarities between Florya’s subject position at the end of the film, the soldier’s anecdote, and Aleksei’s body. Using these three examples, we can better inform our understanding of the toll of sacrifice, the convergences in the results of fascistic and neoliberal ideologies; the foremost of which is trauma. <br>The foremost symptom of trauma present in this definition is the delayed hallucination following the incident Come and See demonstrates this through Florya’s numbed state following the killing of the townspeople, then reawakened when seeing the picture of hitler. Following his psychosis, Florya returns to his numbed state and rejoins the militia. Unlike in other scenes throughout the film, Florya’s face is not focused on. Faces had played an important role since Florya returned to his hometown. Following a traumatic moment, Klimov would focus on a character’s horrified expression, hence, why he subjected Aleksei to hiding under live ammunition. <br>Returning to my original thesis, it is important to ask how this trauma speaks to a critique of neoliberal culture regarding inscription. A good point of comparison is the neoliberal symptom of Homo Economicus. Wendy Brown argues in Undoing the Demos that Homo Economicus becomes the governing rationality (or assumption) under neoliberalism. In other words, assuming the political subject is rational and motivated, those who do not identify as such are ignored and excluded from society. Brown writes: <br>“Thus, the figure of homo oeconomicus is not simply illusory or ideological in its disavowal of the persons and practices that make and sustain human life. Rather, when homo oeconomicus becomes the governing truth, when it organizes law, conduct, policy, and everyday arrangements, the burdens upon and the invisibility of those excluded persons and practices are intensified.” (Brown, 106)<br>While Florya’s journey in Come and See may have resulted in the same sacrifice a soldier may deal with today, Klimov changes the historical narrative to show the economic man in a world without economy. Moreover, it draws into question the role of the non-conformist in war, of which is not applicable to the Byelorussians who lack governance in the first place.<br>This statement was not written to argue that the nazis were portrayed as rational humans. It is well known that discrimination of any level is mathematically irrational due to the additional benefits of cooperation. Rather, nazis were rational under their understanding of nazi ideology, wheras the Byelorusians had no guiding ideology or governance. This leads us to the primary link between 1943 and 1985 by Klimov; Come and See outright puts the audience in the shows of homo politicus as it is vanquished by homo economicus. <br>Wendy Brown describes this replacement as central to neoliberalism’s effect on society (Brown, 107). Homo Politicus is described as the antonym of homo economicus. It is the political subject that seeks cooperation for the greater good. While not acting in its own self interest, it knows that their sacrifice is for the greater good. This is represented by Florya, who joins the militia out of duty for his country. The nazis seek the opposite, and serve to divide and conquer. While Germans have been manipulated by the nazi party, they are still working and fighting for their own self interest to keep and promote arian supremacy. <br>This is seen best in one of the final scenes of the film, of which I mentioned briefly earlier in this essay. The event that causes Florya to enter a psychotic state is the killing of nazi prisoners of war by the Byelorussian militia. Through a nazi translator, they question the role each prisoner had in killing the townspeople. Florya points out the man who gave the order to kill the children. Knowing he is about to die, the nazi confesses: <br>“Yes, I said that: “Come out and leave the children”. I said that because with the children it starts all over again. Not every race has a right to exist. Inferior races spread the contagion of communism. You have no right to be here. Our mission will be accomplished.” (Klimov, 2:04:26)<br>This quote by the nazi officer demonstrates two things. First, he is working in his own self interest. This can be determined due to his lack of naming any leader, ideology, or nation he is loyal to. In addition, his inclusion of  “it starts all over again” shows that he wants the “mission” to be an end to war. Could he be as sick of fighting as the Byelorussians? While likely, I argue his motivations are strictly self interested due to the meaninglessness of his statement. He did not have to say anything seeing as he was essentially at the gallows already. I believe his statement, combined with the actor’s wide eyes and slight smile, was said solety to antagonize the militia, and anger the non-German SS prisoners who claimed they had no role in the burning. <br>Elem Klimov makes his ultimate statement with the film by having the Byelorussians kill the nazis. This opposes neoliberalism by allowing Homo Politicus to vanquish Homo Economicus. The killing calls for viewers to work cooperativley, and say no to discrimination, and working in onesown self interests. <br>Come and See effectively critiques symptoms of neoliberalism by showing the struggle between homo economicus and homo politicus through their personification as opposing sides of the Slavic front of World War II. Using the main character, Florya, as a window into this horrific time period, Klimov contrasts our decision making in war between the two eras. Under neoliberalism, freedom is associated with sacrifice to a slavery-like effect. Things like inscription are performed often under the same threats as those in the past, though the governance which assumes subjects are rational and self interested hinders our choice should we have any at all. Lastly, using Aleksei’s body as a readable text in the film, Klimov shows the consequences of homo-economicus, and through an anti-war film, requests a more achievable return to moral form. </p>
